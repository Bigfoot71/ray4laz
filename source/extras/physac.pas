*   Physac v1.1 - 2D Physics library for videogames
*
*   DESCRIPTION:
*
*   Physac is a small 2D physics engine written in pure C. The engine uses a fixed time-step thread loop
*   to simluate physics. A physics step contains the following phases: get collision information,
*   apply dynamics, collision solving and position correction. It uses a very simple struct for physic
*   bodies with a position vector to be used in any 3D rendering API.
*
*   CONFIGURATION:
*
*   #define PHYSAC_IMPLEMENTATION
*       Generates the implementation of the library into the included file.
*       If not defined, the library is in header only mode and can be included in other headers
*       or source files without problems. But only ONE file should hold the implementation.
*
*   #define PHYSAC_DEBUG
*       Show debug traces log messages about physic bodies creation/destruction, physic system errors,
*       some calculations results and NULL reference exceptions.
*
*   #define PHYSAC_AVOID_TIMMING_SYSTEM
*       Disables internal timming system, used by UpdatePhysics() to launch timmed physic steps,
*       it allows just running UpdatePhysics() automatically on a separate thread at a desired time step.
*       In case physics steps update needs to be controlled by user with a custom timming mechanism,
*       just define this flag and the internal timming mechanism will be avoided, in that case,
*       timming libraries are neither required by the module.
*
*   #define PHYSAC_MALLOC()
*   #define PHYSAC_CALLOC()
*   #define PHYSAC_FREE()
*       You can define your own malloc/free implementation replacing stdlib.h malloc()/free() functions.
*       Otherwise it will include stdlib.h and use the C standard library malloc()/free() function.
*
*   COMPILATION:
*
*   Use the following code to compile with GCC:
*       gcc -o $(NAME_PART).exe $(FILE_NAME) -s -static -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm -std=c99
*
*   VERSIONS HISTORY:
*       1.1 (20-Jan-2021) @raysan5: Library general revision
*               Removed threading system (up to the user)
*               Support MSVC C++ compilation using CLITERAL()
*               Review DEBUG mechanism for TRACELOG() and all TRACELOG() messages
*               Review internal variables/functions naming for consistency
*               Allow option to avoid internal timming system, to allow app manage the steps
*       1.0 (12-Jun-2017) First release of the library
